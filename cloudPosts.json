By default, all of the code that we write in our apps is executed on the \"main thread\", however, if the main thread ever gets overwhelmed with tasks, it can slow down, freeze, or even crash our app. Luckily, Apple provides us with easy access to many other threads that we can use to offload some of the work!\n\nWe will review how to add different threads, how to perform tasks on a background thread, and how to return back to the main thread afterward. As we get into the second half of this course, we will begin to use background threads more often as we begin to do data intensive tasks, such as downloading data from the internet.",

Before displaying content on the screen, you will (almost always) want to organize the data to show specific pieces of content. In order to do this, we will learn how to use 3 super-efficient modifiers that Apple provides us with:\n\n1. Sort - organize data by criteria\n2. Filter - create a subset of your data\n3. Map - transform data from one type to another\n\nAs you can imagine, being able to sort, filter, or map data is used ALL the time in production applications. We will learn how to implement these methods and also learn some fancy ways to shorten the code to look like professional developers ;)",

    "intro" : "The Hashable protocol is very similar to the Identifiable protocol that I've been using throughout my courses - it's another way to give a unique identifier to an object. In reality, hashing is actually MUCH more complex than this, but this is all you really need to understand for our purposes. When we use hash values in SwiftUI applications it's usually to let the system identify which object is which.\n\nHashing is not unique to Swift\/SwiftUI. It is often used in web development and cryptography (yes, in Blockchains and Bitcoin too). If you're interested, there are many articles and YouTube videos that go into detail on how hashing really works. Thankfully, we don't have to get into those details when we implement Apple's Hashable protocol.",

Thankfully, the SwiftUI framework includes the @ObservableObject and @StateObject property wrappers for this purpose. In this video we will create \"view model\" which is a custom class that will manage the data for our View and then implement both of these new property wrappers into our iOS application."

When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!)."

    "intro" : "Regardless of what framework or tool that’s used to build a given UI, finding a good way to separate the structure and internal logic of our various views from the styles that are being applied to them is often key in order to make UI code easier to maintain and manage.\n\nWhile certain technologies offer a quite natural way of separating those two aspects of UI development, such as how websites declare their structure through HTML and their styles using CSS — when it comes to SwiftUI, it might not initially seem like that kind of separation is practical, or even encouraged.\n\nHowever, if we start exploring SwiftUI’s various APIs and conventions a bit further, it turns out that there are a number of tools and techniques that we can use to create a clean separation between our view hierarchy, its styles, and the components that we’re looking to reuse across a given project.\n\nThat’s exactly what we’ll take a look at in this week’s article.",

    "intro" : "In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",

This is great for chat apps or any content-based app where users might want to share some text with a friend.
