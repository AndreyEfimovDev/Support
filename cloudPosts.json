    "intro" : "One of the most underrated features released in iOS 15 is the ability to let users select and copy text in SwiftUI. In this quick video, we will learn how to use the .textSelection modifier! This feature probably did not need it's own video, but I think it's a pretty important feature to know about. This is great for chat apps or any content-based app where users might want to share some text with a friend. Sharing is not only a great feature for your users, but will help drive organic growth as users share with others.",

    "intro" : "In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",

It allows you to identify and respond to potential problems in a controlled and predictable manner, rather than allowing them to cause your program to crash.\n\nIn Swift, errors are represented by values of types that conform to the Error protocol. When a function encounters an error, it can throw an error using the throw statement. The error can then be caught and handled by a surrounding do-catch statement.",

Whether you’re developing an application for the sole purpose of checking the network connection or simply trying to optimize user experience, knowing how to check network connectivity in your Swift application can be a game-changer.\n\nIn this guide, we will check the network connection inside a SwiftUI application using NWPathMonitor, which was introduced in iOS 12.\n\nNB: Before diving into this guide, it’s a good idea to test on an iPhone and not the simulator.",

When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both!

Thankfully, the SwiftUI framework includes the @ObservableObject and @StateObject property wrappers for this purpose. In this video we will create \"view model\" which is a custom class that will manage the data for our View and then implement both of these new property wrappers into our iOS application.",

In reality, hashing is actually MUCH more complex than this, but this is all you really need to understand for our purposes. When we use hash values in SwiftUI applications it's usually to let the system identify which object is which.\n\nHashing is not unique to Swift\/SwiftUI. It is often used in web development and cryptography (yes, in Blockchains and Bitcoin too). If you're interested, there are many articles and YouTube videos that go into detail on how hashing really works. Thankfully, we don't have to get into those details when we implement Apple's Hashable protocol.",

Before displaying content on the screen, you will (almost always) want to organize the data to show specific pieces of content. In order to do this, we will learn how to use 3 super-efficient modifiers that Apple provides us with:\n\n1. Sort - organize data by criteria\n2. Filter - create a subset of your data\n3. Map - transform data from one type to another\n\nAs you can imagine, being able to sort, filter, or map data is used ALL the time in production applications. We will learn how to implement these methods and also learn some fancy ways to shorten the code to look like professional developers ;)",
