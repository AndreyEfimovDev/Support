Map - transform data from one type to another\n\nAs you can imagine, being able to sort, filter, or map data is used ALL the time in production applications. We will learn how to implement these methods and also learn some fancy ways to shorten the code to look like professional developers ;)",

In reality, hashing is actually MUCH more complex than this, but this is all you really need to understand for our purposes. When we use hash values in SwiftUI applications it's usually to let the system identify which object is which.\n\nHashing is not unique to Swift\/SwiftUI. It is often used in web development and cryptography (yes, in Blockchains and Bitcoin too). If you're interested, there are many articles and YouTube videos that go into detail on how hashing really works. Thankfully, we don't have to get into those details when we implement Apple's Hashable protocol.",

Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",

However, their similar performance in certain scenarios often causes confusion among developers when making a choice. This article aims to analyze the characteristics and advantages of these two components to help you make a better decision.",

    "intro" : "In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",
