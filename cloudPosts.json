This works also on the iPhone when you set it up with List selections, but really shines for the mac and the iPad. \nNavigationSplitView allows for further custom styling with navigationSplitViewStyle for prominentDetail and balanced. You can also set the column width and show\/hide columns programmatically. \nNavigationSplitView came with SwiftUI 4 during WWDC 2022."

We will develop a mock application that contains three types of entities: Businesses, Departments, and Employees. These entities will have many relationships between them, including one-to-one and one-to-many relationships!\n\nIn addition to implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions, we will learn how to sort and filter (predicate) Core Data fetch requests. We will also learn how to properly delete Core Data relationships by using Deny, Cascade, and Nullify delete rules.",

Before displaying content on the screen, you will (almost always) want to organize the data to show specific pieces of content. In order to do this, we will learn how to use 3 super-efficient modifiers that Apple provides us with:\n\n1. Sort - organize data by criteria\n2. Filter - create a subset of your data\n3. Map - transform data from one type to another\n\nAs you can imagine, being able to sort, filter, or map data is used ALL the time in production applications. We will learn how to implement these methods and also learn some fancy ways to shorten the code to look like professional developers ;)",

    "intro" : "The Hashable protocol is very similar to the Identifiable protocol that I've been using throughout my courses - it's another way to give a unique identifier to an object. In reality, hashing is actually MUCH more complex than this, but this is all you really need to understand for our purposes. When we use hash values in SwiftUI applications it's usually to let the system identify which object is which.\n\nHashing is not unique to Swift\/SwiftUI. It is often used in web development and cryptography (yes, in Blockchains and Bitcoin too). If you're interested, there are many articles and YouTube videos that go into detail on how hashing really works. Thankfully, we don't have to get into those details when we implement Apple's Hashable protocol.",

Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both!

It allows users to scroll through views that exceed the screen’s boundaries, providing a seamless and interactive scrolling experience.\n\nThe ScrollView automatically adjusts its content size based on the views it contains, enabling the user to scroll vertically or horizontally through the content. It handles various complexities, such as dynamic content heights, nested scroll views, and lazy loading, making it a versatile tool for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.",

    "intro" : "In the world of SwiftUI, List and LazyVStack, as two core lazy containers, offer robust support for developers to display large amounts of data. However, their similar performance in certain scenarios often causes confusion among developers when making a choice. This article aims to analyze the characteristics and advantages of these two components to help you make a better decision.",

    "intro" : "Regardless of what framework or tool that’s used to build a given UI, finding a good way to separate the structure and internal logic of our various views from the styles that are being applied to them is often key in order to make UI code easier to maintain and manage.\n\nWhile certain technologies offer a quite natural way of separating those two aspects of UI development, such as how websites declare their structure through HTML and their styles using CSS — when it comes to SwiftUI, it might not initially seem like that kind of separation is practical, or even encouraged.\n\nHowever, if we start exploring SwiftUI’s various APIs and conventions a bit further, it turns out that there are a number of tools and techniques that we can use to create a clean separation between our view hierarchy, its styles, and the components that we’re looking to reuse across a given project.\n\nThat’s exactly what we’ll take a look at in this week’s article.",

    "intro" : "In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",
