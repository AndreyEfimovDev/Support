# PRIVACY POLICY

**Last Updated:** 28 January 2026

## Introduction

StartToSwiftUI (the "App", "we") respects your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information within our application.

## Summary

*   We do not collect personal data.
*   All data is stored locally on your device.
*   We do not track your activity.
*   We do not share data with third parties.
*   We do not use analytics or advertising services.

## 1. Data We Handle

The App does **not** collect, store, or transmit any user personal data to external servers.

**Data you create within the App:**
*   Your own content for mastering SwiftUI.
*   Titles, introductory information, and personal notes.
*   Metadata (e.g., author, source, date).

All such data is stored exclusively on your device using built-in iOS data persistence mechanisms (SwiftData + CloudKit, FileManager, and UserDefaults).

## 2. Where Data Is Stored

*   All data is stored locally on your iPhone or iPad.
*   We do not have access to your data.
*   Data is not transmitted to our servers or to third-party servers.

## 3. Curated Collection Download

When downloading the pre-built collection of SwiftUI materials:
*   The collection is downloaded into the App from a cloud service **only** at your explicit request.
*   The data then resides solely on your device.
*   We do not track which collections you download.
*   We do not know which content you view.

## 4. External References

The App may contain references to external educational resources (e.g., learning videos, articles).

**Important:** When you follow these references, you leave our App. External sites have their own privacy policies and practices, over which we have no control and for which we accept no responsibility. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any external site you visit.

## 5. Your Rights and Management

You have full control over your data:

*   **Data Deletion:** Uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data.
*   **Data Export:** You can export your content from within the App.
*   **Control:** You decide which content to add, edit, or remove.

## 6. Data Security

Your data is protected by the built-in security and encryption mechanisms of the iOS operating system. Access to the data is restricted to users of the device on which the App is installed.

## 7. Children

The App is intended for general educational use and is suitable for all ages. As we do not collect any data from users, we consequently do not collect any data from children.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you of significant changes by:
*   Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
*   Providing a notification within the App upon your next launch.

Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
